# Smart Contract for Earnings

One unique feature of the C4C exchange is the utilization of a smart contract to hold the funds earned on the platform. The earnings are distributed through ownership shares, not tokens. Owners of C4C tokens can redeem 50% of the smart contract on a weekly or monthly basis, allowing for a steady stream of passive income.
