# Mission:

Welcome to Crypto 4 A Cause!

Crypto 4 A Cause is a blockchain-based project that aims to combine the power of cryptocurrency with charitable causes. The project seeks to leverage blockchain technology to create a protocol that will donate a percentage of every transaction made on its platform to a charity wallet connected to the project's DAO. The charity wallet will be governed by the DAO and used to fund various charitable causes. This white paper outlines the goals, milestones, and inner workings of the project, as well as the roadmap for its development.
