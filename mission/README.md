# Introduction to our Dapp

OMoD (One Medical on Decentralized) is a blockchain-based medical data management application built on the C4Chain private network. OMoD aims to address the problems of centralized medical data management systems by providing patients with complete control over their medical records in a secure and decentralized manner.

### How OMoD Works

OMoD stores patient data on the C4Chain network, ensuring the data is encrypted and HIPAA-compliant. The C4Chain network provides a secure, decentralized storage solution that allows users to control their data access and sharing. By utilizing blockchain technology, OMoD ensures that patients' medical records are immutable and can only be accessed with the owner's consent.

### Features and Benefits of OMoD

OMoD offers a range of features and benefits to its users, including:

#### Secure and Decentralized Storage

OMoD uses the C4Chain network to store medical data, ensuring that it is secure and decentralized. The data is encrypted and only accessible with the owner's consent, ensuring that patient data is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Complete Control Over Medical Data

OMoD enables patients to have complete control over their medical data. Patients can choose who can access their data and can revoke access at any time. This gives patients greater control over their medical data, reducing the likelihood of data breaches and misuse.

#### Smart Notifications for Pregnant Women

OMoD provides pregnant women with smart notifications, alerting them to important milestones and appointments. The application can also notify doulas and midwives of incoming births, ensuring that the birthing process is as smooth as possible.

#### One Instance of Medical Data

OMoD ensures that there is only one instance of a patient's medical data, eliminating the need for multiple data sharing apps. This reduces the likelihood of data breaches and ensures that patients' medical records are secure and protected.
