With numerous data breaches and leaks in recent years, it's clear that traditional storage methods are no longer adequate for safeguarding our health data, and this is where Crypto 4 A Cause comes in.

Our platform will allow users to securely store and manage their own personal medical data on the IPFS registry, which is designed to retain all metadata saved from the app, and allows for only one owner - the person that the data pertains to. We understand the importance of privacy and security when it comes to personal health information, which is why our platform utilizes cutting-edge technology to ensure that only the owner of the information has access to it.&#x20;

We believe in the future of smartphone and wearable biometrics and that is why we have designed our platform to record health data through these devices, giving users complete control over their personal health information. Our app will allow users to input and save their medical data from any country, taking away the occurrence of data mining and lack of adequate medical information.

As we progress in the development of Crypto 4 A Cause, we will be following a roadmap to ensure that we are delivering a platform that meets the needs of our users. Our roadmap will include key milestones and deadlines to ensure that we are on track to deliver a cutting-edge solution to manage and store health data securely.

Our dedication to the project is unwavering, and we are committed to providing a secure and reliable solution to manage and store health data. We believe that our project has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives and we are excited to bring it to market.

Thank you for your interest in Crypto 4 A Cause, and we look forward to revolutionizing the way we store and manage our sensitive health data.
