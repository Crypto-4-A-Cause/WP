# Problem & Solution

Problem Statement

Centralized medical data management systems are often vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches, which can compromise patients' sensitive medical information. These systems also lack transparency and do not provide patients with full control over their medical data. Additionally, traditional data management systems require patients to manage multiple data-sharing apps, leading to inefficiencies and increased risks of data breaches. Furthermore, expectant mothers in impoverished communities face significant challenges during childbirth, including a lack of access to proper healthcare facilities and information.

Solution

OMoD offers a solution to these challenges by providing a secure, decentralized, and HIPAA-compliant medical data management system. Using blockchain technology, OMoD ensures that patients' medical records are immutable and can only be accessed with the owner's consent. OMoD also provides patients with complete control over their medical data, allowing them to choose who can access their data and revoke access at any time. Furthermore, OMoD provides smart notifications for expectant mothers, alerting them to important milestones and appointments. This feature ensures that expectant mothers receive timely and relevant information, improving their overall birthing experience.

OMoD is built on the C4Chain private network, which provides secure and decentralized storage for medical data. The C4Chain network uses Polygon Edge for enhanced data security and scalability. The network also utilizes the metadata-saving features of Filecoin and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to change the way NFTs are used. OMoD ensures that there is only one instance of a patient's medical data, eliminating the need for multiple data-sharing apps. This feature reduces the likelihood of data breaches and ensures that patients' medical records are secure and protected.

Requirements for Medical Professionals

To ensure that medical professionals understand and can effectively use OMoD, Crypto 4 A Cause will provide training and support to healthcare providers. OMoD is compatible with existing healthcare information systems, allowing medical professionals to access patient data quickly and easily. The application also provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for healthcare providers to manage patient data securely and efficiently.
