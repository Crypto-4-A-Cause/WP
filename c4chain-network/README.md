# C4Chain Network

Blockchain technology offers unique advantages in the field of medical data management, providing secure and decentralized storage, complete control over medical data, and smart notifications for pregnant women. However, existing blockchain-based medical data management solutions have limitations, including slow transaction times, high fees, and limited scalability. This whitepaper proposes a new solution, OMoD (One Medical on Decentralized), a blockchain-based medical data management application built on the C4Chain private network, which addresses the problems of centralized medical data management systems by providing patients with complete control over their medical records in a secure and decentralized manner. OMoD will utilize the advantages of Polygon Edge to provide fast and efficient transaction processing, low fees, and interoperability with other EVM-compatible chains.

In this flow chart, the doctor and insurance company are highlighted as separate entities that interact with the C4Chain and its associated DApps. The IPFS and Filecoin technologies are also included to highlight their role in storing and sharing patient data securely.
