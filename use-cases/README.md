# Use Cases

Introducing Crypto 4 A Cause, an ERC-20 token that is set to change the game for charitable giving and digital ownership. Our innovative token, paired with its associated DAO, offers a new way to give back to causes that matter to you, allowing users to vote on proposals and donate money to a variety of charities. But that's not all, we are experimenting to provide a new way to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets by saving metadata to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which will be accessed by healthcare professionals in the event of an emergency. This new feature also allow users to transfer assets such as medical insurance policies to help cover hospital bills. With Crypto 4 A Cause, you can make a difference and take control of your digital assets.

{% tab title="Use case #1: Charitable giving" %}
The decentralized nature of the Crypto 4 A Cause DAO allows users to have a say in where their donations go. By voting on proposals, users can choose which charities they want to support and how much they want to contribute. This ensures that the funds are used in a transparent and accountable manner, as all votes and transactions are recorded on the blockchain.

In addition to voting on proposals, users will also be able to submit their own proposals for charitable projects. This allows the community to come together and collaborate on making a positive impact in the world.

Users can complete proposals with their tokens as well as suggest votes to the team and community. DAO will also be how we promote and propose hackathons and other treasury disbursements regarding the team.&#x20;

{% tab title="Use case #2: Digital ownership" %}
The Crypto 4 A Cause app allows users to save metadata to NFTs, creating a new way to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets. This can be particularly useful for artists, photographers, and other users who want to protect their intellectual property (personal data) and ensure that they are credited for their work.

By saving metadata to an NFT, users can create a permanent and unchangeable record of their ownership of a digital asset. This can be used to establish copyright and prevent unauthorized use or duplication of the asset.&#x20;

{% tab title="Use case #4: Medical vitals" %}
The Crypto 4 A Cause app will revolutionize the way we store and access our medical information. With this innovative app, you can safeguard your medical vitals as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in a secure and transparent manner. This creates a permanent, unchangeable digital record of your medical history that can be accessed by healthcare professionals in case of an emergency.

But that's not all! This feature also allows you to transfer assets such as medical insurance policies to help cover hospital bills. By storing these assets as NFTs, you can ensure easy accessibility and smooth, efficient transfer processes. Our team is also experimenting with IPFS registry for metadata transfer and retrieval success, allowing for permissionless entry into metadata streams to form the foundation of our blockchain, layering a protocol over our NFT storage strategy and creating a bridge of vital medical data.
