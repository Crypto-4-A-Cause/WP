# NFT Innovation

The Crypto 4 a Cause project is proud to announce a new and innovative component to its platform. Our web and mobile app will allow members of the community to take control of their personal health information by inputting and saving their medical data in a secure and accessible database. With this new feature, users will no longer need to rely solely on their local doctor to have access to their complete medical history. In case of an emergency, they can quickly retrieve and share their medical information with medical professionals, even if they are far from home. The app uses cutting-edge technology, such as smartphone biometrics and wearable biometrics, to collect and record health data. This data is then stored in a secure, decentralized database that is only accessible to the user who holds the key. The information is also saved in the IPFS registry, which ensures that all metadata is retained, and that the information can only be accessed by its rightful owner. With this new addition to the Crypto 4 a Cause platform, we aim to improve the accuracy and accessibility of medical information, while also giving users complete control over their personal health data.One of the key benefits of this system is that it eliminates the need for a centralized third-party to store and manage the data. Instead, each user has control over their own information, which can be recorded using smartphone biometrics and wearable devices. This makes it easy for individuals to keep track of their health history, even if they don't regularly see a doctor.

Our team is developing a revolutionary web and mobile app that empowers individuals to take control of their personal medical information. With the rise of health data breaches and the potential loss of control over one's personal information, our platform aims to provide a secure and reliable solution. By utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technology, we are able to create a secure database of health information that is only accessible by its rightful owner.

At the heart of our platform is a smart contract structure that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to transfer and retain information. Unlike traditional coin blockchains, NFTs are only opened with a unique key that is only owned by one user. This enhances security and gives the owner complete control over their sensitive information. Additionally, our platform utilizes the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store all metadata saved from our app, ensuring that the information is easily accessible and always up-to-date.

Our app allows users to input and store their medical data, including biometric data collected from smartphones and wearable devices. This information is then saved as an NFT and can be used in case of emergency when an individual is unable to access their local doctor's medical information. Our platform eliminates the need for data mining and the occurrence of inadequate medical information, providing a comprehensive and reliable medical history for every individual.

In addition to being a valuable resource in emergency situations, our app also serves as a way for individuals to take control of their personal health information and manage their health in a proactive and informed manner. By giving individuals the ability to input their medical data from any country, we are creating a global community of informed and empowered individuals who can make informed decisions about their health.

Our platform is an integral part of the Crypto 4 a Cause project, using the power of technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. We believe that by taking control of personal health information, individuals can improve their overall health and well-being, and we are committed to making this vision a reality.
