# Charity

$C4C aims to not only donate to world issues but challenge competitors to place priority on their communities, where the real wealth is.

\
Our non-profit disbursements are determined through a voting process in which C4C holders cast their ballots on proposals to donate to various charities. In addition to these direct donations, we also plan to use non- fungible tokens (NFTs) on the OpenSea platform to help fund communities in need. Each NFT collection will be associated with a specific charity, and a portion of the proceeds from every sale will be donated to that charity. This will allow us to leverage the power of decentralized finance (DeFi) to make a difference and support those in need.

How do we achieve that?

\
$C4C has developed a community sustainability model that we will implement through an initial coin offering (ICO) and launch. Our developers are real people like you and I, and they have dedicated their time and expertise to finding and sharing information about various non-profits and how they address educational, financial, and resource-related needs caused by non-autonomous conditions. To support this mission, we will have a section of our website dedicated to identifying and showcasing qualifying foreign and local causes that need assistance in these challenging times. Without going into too many specifics, our goal is to use the resources and expertise of our community to create a positive impact and help those in need.

How do edu-grants work?

\
As part of our efforts to promote education and combat misinformation, our team has partnered with online teaching platforms such as eDx.org and Udemy.com to offer full tuition for yearly courses in a field of the participant's choice. Our goal is to award education grants ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 every nine months to eligible participants. We believe that this will help us to make a meaningful impact and empower individuals to learn new skills and advance their careers.

How do the charity donations work?

\
It is our pleasure to give back to communities by donating to non-profits that are making a positive impact on the lives of their neighborhood and members. We will do this as a community, with links and commentary about each charity selection available on our website. The frequency of these donations will depend on the number of voters and the submission of new charities for vetting, but we aim to make a donation every one to three months. By working together, we hope to support organizations that are making a difference in their communities.
