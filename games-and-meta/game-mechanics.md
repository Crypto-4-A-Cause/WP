# Game Mechanics

The game mechanics of the Crypto 4 A Cause (C4C) project in a futuristic cyberpunk setting are as follows:

1. Levels and Roles: The game has multiple levels, ranging from a lowly scavenger to a powerful cybercrime lord. Players advance through the levels by acquiring and upgrading their LMEC NFTs, with each level granting new abilities and responsibilities.
2. Objectives: The ultimate goal of the game is to attain the highest level of power and influence, by acquiring and upgrading NFTs, engaging in cyber-attacks and hacking, and defending against threats.
3. Combat: Players engage in cyber-battles against other players, either as individuals or as part of a team. The game utilizes an advanced turn-based combat system, where players utilize their NFTs and advanced cyberweapons to hack and disable their opponents.
4. NFTs: LMEC NFTs are the primary currency and item in the game, providing players with advanced cyber-abilities and bonuses as they are upgraded. Specialized NFTs can be obtained through high-level cyber-operations and provide a significant advantage in combat.
5. Rogue Players: Rogue players are cyber-criminals who indiscriminately attack other players in the virtual world. They are considered a threat and can only be defeated by a high-level player or by disrupting their advanced cyber-operations.
6. Businesses: Players can establish and own their own cyber-businesses, earning virtual currency through advanced cyber-operations, and utilizing their earnings to further upgrade their abilities.
7. In-Game Currency: The game utilizes C4C token as itâ€™s native virtual currency, which can be earned through various cyber-operations such as hacking and infiltrating high-level targets. This currency can be used to purchase NFTs, cyber-weaponry, and other advanced cyber-assets.
8. Game World: The virtual world of the C4C project is a vast cyber-realm, where players can explore and interact with advanced cyber-structures and engage in advanced cyber-operations.
9. High-Level Responsibilities: As a high-level cybercrime lord, players are responsible for defending their cyber-territories and aiding their allies in times of cyber-conflict.
10. Cyber-Events: Players can host advanced cyber-events and parties for other members of the community, earning virtual currency and prestige.
11. Cyber-Team Play: Players can join forces with other players to engage in advanced cyber- operations and cyber-attacks, either as cyber-hackers or cyber-infiltrators.

These game mechanics create a futuristic cyberpunk experience for players, allowing them to advance through the levels, engage in advanced cyber-battles, and interact with the virtual world and other players in a highly advanced cyber-realm.
