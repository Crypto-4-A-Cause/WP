# Multi-Bridge FAQS

Crypto 4 A Cause is an ERC-20 token that is built on a specific blockchain, but it may also be bridged to other blockchains to provide additional utility and liquidity. To ensure the safety of the bridged token, Crypto

4 A Cause employs a number of multi-bridge function calls, including burning and minting mechanisms..

\
Crypto 4 Cause is an ERC-20 token that may be bridged to other blockchains to provide additional utility and liquidity. In some cases, the token may already exist on a particular chain as a native asset, such as USDC. In these instances, it is not possible for the multichain to mint the asset, and alternative methods must be used to facilitate cross-chain transactions.

Native assets:

When a token already exists on a particular chain, it is referred to as a native asset. These assets are created and managed directly on the chain, and they cannot be minted by a multichain. Examples of native assets include USDC, BTC, and ETH.

Liquidity pools:

To facilitate cross-chain transactions with native assets, a multichain may use liquidity pools. These pools are essentially collections of tokens that are added by the multichain, a project team, or individuals to a specific chain. When a user wants to move a token cross-chain, they can access the liquidity pool on the destination chain and exchange their token for the native asset.

Native assets and liquidity pools are important tools for facilitating cross-chain transactions with tokens that already exist on a particular chain. By using these mechanisms, Crypto 4 Cause can provide its users with greater flexibility and utility when moving their tokens between different blockchains.
