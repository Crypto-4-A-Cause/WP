# Inner Workings:

The Crypto 4 A Cause platform will be built on the Polygon network, which is known for its high speed and low transaction costs. The platform will be accessible through a web interface and a mobile application, making it easy for users to access and donate from anywhere in the world.

When users make transactions on the platform, a percentage of the transaction amount will be sent to a charity wallet. The DAO will then decide which charities will receive donations based on their needs and impact. The DAO will also ensure that donations are being used efficiently and transparently.
