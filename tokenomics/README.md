To make sure the company can survive through good times and bad, it's important to manage its treasury requirements carefully. This means planning and budgeting for expenses and making sure there are enough funds to support the company's operations and initiatives.

Marketing is also a big part of keeping the company going. The goal is to increase awareness of the cause and the token, and to attract new users and investors. This could include traditional marketing methods like advertising and PR, as well as newer approaches like social media campaigns and partnerships with influencers.

Research is another important aspect of sustainability. This could include market research to understand the needs and preferences of potential customers, as well as research into new technologies and trends that might be relevant to the company's operations.

Educational grant funding can also play a key role in supporting the company. By providing funding for research and education initiatives related to the cause, the company can generate new ideas and insights that can be applied to its operations and initiatives.

So, to sum it up, the key to sustaining the company through market highs and lows is to have a clear strategy for managing its treasury requirements and being proactive in identifying and addressing potential risks and challenges. By careful planning and budgeting, and by investing in marketing, research, and educational grant funding, the company can set itself up for long-term success.
