# ðŸ›£ ROADMAP

In the third quarter of 2022, the team plans to conduct a private sale and list their ICO on various exchanges, while also completing KYC (know your customer) processes. They also plan to create NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and launch a marketing campaign, as well as release a beta version of their DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). In the fourth quarter of 2022, the team plans to conduct a public sale and apply to be listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC), as well as hold an AMA (ask me anything) event and forge partnerships with non-profit organizations. They also plan to list their DEX (decentralized exchange) and launch beta versions of their multi-chain yield farm and NFT farming.

In the first quarter of 2023, the team plans to launch $C4C and test their DAO's proposal system, while also releasing a beta version of the C4C exchange and minting a new NFT collection. They also plan to list the exchange and deploy play-to-earn NFTs for game fundraising and marketing efforts. In the third quarter of 2023, the team plans to engage in R\&D (research and development) on blockchain creation, C4C stablecoin development, and ERC721 use case development. It is important to note that roadmaps are subject to change and the actual timeline for achieving these milestones may differ from what is outlined in the roadmap.
